Download the model you want to use:

For medium model (good but not great): https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph.zip

For large model: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip

Extract the the compressed folder's contents. They should look like this:
model-name
-->model-name
---->am
---->conf
---->...
---->...

Move the INNER-MOST 'model-name' directory into THIS DIRECTORY (/src/transcriptionAlternativeSpikes/vosk).

Edit the voskSpike.js file at line 9 so modelName refers to whatever the name of the directory (above) is.

Edit voskSpike.js file at line 8 so fileName refers to whatever audio file you want to test with (depending where it is, you might also need to edit line 12).
NOTE that only .wav files with mono audio channel are compatible
